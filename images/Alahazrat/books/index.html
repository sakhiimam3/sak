<p>He wrote devotional poetry in praise of the Prophet Muhammad and always discussed him in the present tense.[33] His main book of poetry is Hadaikh-e-Bakhshish.[34] His poems, which deal for the most part with the qualities of the Prophet, often have a simplicity and directness.[35] They reportedly created a favorable climate for na'at writing.[36] His Urdu couplets, entitled Mustafa jaane rahmat pe lakhon salaam (Millions of salutations on Mustafa, the Paragon of mercy), are read in movements mosques. They contain praise of the Prophet, his physical appearance (verses 33 to 80), his life and times, praise of his family and companions, praise of the awliya and saleheen (the saints and the pious) </p>

<p>bd Allah ibn Abbas (Arabic: عَبْد ٱللَّٰه ٱبْن عَبَّاس‎; c. 619– 687), also known simply as Ibn Abbas, was the son of Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib, an uncle of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and a nephew of the Maymunah bint al-Harith, who later became Muhammad's wife. He was one of Muhammad's cousins and one of the early Qur'an scholars.[1][8]

   During the early struggles for the caliphate he supported Ali, and was made governor of Basra. He withdrew to Mecca shortly afterwards. During the reign of Muawiyah I he lived in Hejaz and travelled to Damascus often. After Muawiyah I died he fled to at-Ta'if, where he died in around 687 CE.[1][9]
   
   'Abd Allah ibn Abbas was known for his knowledge of traditions and his critical interpretation of the Qur'an. From early on, he gathered information from other companions of Muhammad and gave classes and wrote commentaries. </p>
